# Note on values used for voice generation:

Currently these values are hardcoded.

- temperature = 0.9
- min_p = 0.07
- top_p = 1.0
- repetition_penalty = 2.0
- cfg_weight = 0.0
- exaggeration = 0.7

Edit `skyrimnet_config.txt` if you would like to use the controls from the SkyrimNet UI.

Be sure to change the values in SkyrimNet UI before loading your save, errors will occur with some values.
Randomize Seed should usually be Disabled.

All other Audio fields are ignored.


- MIN_P: Modern way to control speech quality (newer method)  

- TOP_P: Classic way to control speech variety (older method) Probably want to keep this at 1.0 (disabled)

- TEMPERATURE: Controls how creative/random the voice sounds
 *Note: This uses the "linear" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"

- REPETITION_PENALTY: Stops the voice from repeating words too much
  * Note: This uses the 'confidence' slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"

- CFG_WEIGHT: Controls speech pacing and guidance strength
  * Note: This uses the "cfg_scale" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"

- EXAGGERATION: Controls emotion intensity and expression
  *  Note: This uses the "quadratic" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"

# Supported Languages 
Arabic (ar) • Danish (da) • German (de) • Greek (el) • English (en) • Spanish (es) • Finnish (fi) • French (fr) • Hebrew (he) • Hindi (hi) • Italian (it) • Japanese (ja) • Korean (ko) • Malay (ms) • Dutch (nl) • Norwegian (no) • Polish (pl) • Portuguese (pt) • Russian (ru) • Swedish (sv) • Swahili (sw) • Turkish (tr) • Chinese (zh)
# Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip’s language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


# Installation
```shell
pip install chatterbox-tts
```

Alternatively, you can install from source:
```shell
# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .
```
We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debian 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.

# Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

# English example
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-english.wav", wav, model.sr)

# Multilingual examples
multilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)

french_text = "Bonjour, comment ça va? Ceci est le modèle de synthèse vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues."
wav_french = multilingual_model.generate(spanish_text, language_id="fr")
ta.save("test-french.wav", wav_french, model.sr)

chinese_text = "你好，今天天气真不错，希望你有一个愉快的周末。"
wav_chinese = multilingual_model.generate(chinese_text, language_id="zh")
ta.save("test-chinese.wav", wav_chinese, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

# Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```

## Developer notes: single-source modules and refactors

This project now centralizes several cross-cutting concerns into small focused utilities to keep the code DRY, easier to test, and consistent across layers (UI/bridge/pipeline/caches):

- Voice parameter merging: `src/voice_params.py::get_voice_params`
  - Precedence: models defaults < globals (tts/audio) < per-voice overrides < per-request overrides.
  - `config.get_voice_params(...)` delegates to this canonical merger with LRU caching.

- Audio path validation: `src/audio/paths.py`
  - `sanitize_input_path(path)` for lightweight UI/bridge sanity.
  - `validate_user_audio(path, min_dur)` as the single authority for file existence/duration/waveform checks.
  - Used by pipeline phases and caches for consistent behavior.

- Cache key generation: `src/cache_keys.py::generate_audio_cache_key`
  - Single source of truth for audio/fuzzy cache keys and context-generated keys.

- Conditionals validity: `src/generate/cache/conditionals_utils.py`
  - `is_valid_conditionals(obj)` and `is_mock_conditionals(obj)` shared by caches and phases.

- Output formatting for UI/API: `src/output_utils.py::format_output`
  - Standardizes return shape and provides a reusable silence WAV fallback (via `src/audio_fallbacks.py`).

- Config persistence service: `src/config/service.py::save_voice_overrides`
  - Diffs overrides against the effective baseline and writes only changes; creates timestamped backups.

- Post-processing modularization: `src/audio/`
  - Stateless numpy-based transforms in `transforms.py` (trim, gate, filters, rate, fade).
  - Pipeline phase delegates to these helpers to stay thin and testable.

Other notable changes:
- Removed legacy `cfgw` field; canonical internal name is `cfg_weight`.
- Fuzzy indexing happens after successful generation in the Output phase; a simple in-process idempotency guard avoids duplicate indexing of the same key.
- Conditionals cache now tracks `purges` separately from `misses` for accurate metrics.
